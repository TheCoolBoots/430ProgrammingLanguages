Essay 2, David Reko

1. Graham thought that three advantages that gave his company
a technical advantage:
  -It was a web-based software application (it could be written
   in any language that they wanted). This was important because
   it allowed them to create software in a language that
   best fit the task that they were trying to accomplish.
  -It has more powerful features than other high-level languages.
   Macros are something that is special to Lisp, and it was
   instrumental in creating their product, as he states that
   20-25% of the product was written using macros.
  -Both developers were well versed in the language they were
   able to release improved software at a very high rate. This
   allowed them to keep up with their competitors and introduce
   features faster than anybody else.

2. Graham makes two important observations about programming
and programming languages:
  -Programming languages aren't simply technology, yet they are
   what programmers think in. I think that this is a very
   important observation because it shows that programmers are
   limited by thinking in one way, and this is why they might
   be limited in what they feel that they can create.
  -The power spectrum of programming languages. Graham talks about
   how programming languages all have different power, and it
   depends on the perspective of the programmer to see and understand
   their respective powers.

3. Questions that I feel that I should ask when approaching a
new language:
  -What is the purpose and who is the target user for this
   programming language?
  -What is the user base for this language like, what types of
   support systems are behind the language?
  -Do people love this language, or do they use it simply for
   its ease of use?
