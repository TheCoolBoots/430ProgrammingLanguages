1. Graham and his co-founders knew Lisp well. Rather than learn a whole new language they stuck with
what they knew best. Lisp also allowed for rapid development. They were able to write code faster than
their competitors and deploy features just days after competitors announced competing features. This
allowed them to completely outpace and out-perform competitors until they were the only ones left.
Lastly, Lisp allowed Graham and his team to do things that simply weren't possible in other high
level languages. He mentioned that 20-25% of the code was only possible in Lisp which also gave them
an edge.

2. According to Graham, there is a programming language that exists that is fundimentally better
than other programming languages. This is significant because it naturally leads to the next question,
"What is the best programming language." Like Graham says, I think the answer will change based on who
you ask and there is someone on top of everything that can say definitively what the best language is.
Another claim Graham makes is that programming language evolution moves "as slow as an iceberg." I have
always considered languages as a constant -- I don't ever expect Java or Python to evolve so much that
I wouldn't recognize it.

3. Who created the language and for what reason? Who is using the language? Why do people choose to
use the language?
