Hello,

I have decided that, moving forward, our next project will be to
create a new mobile operating system. This operating system will
need to be able to outperform our competitors, as well as
bringing new ideas and innovations to the mobile operating system
world. After serious consideration, I have identified several important
criteria for the programming language that will be used to create
this new system. I feel that the three most important qualities
that this language must have are that it has direct memory access,
must be easily readable, and must be highly efficient. These are all
qualities that will lend themselves well to the creation of a
new operating system. Direct memory access is very important to
the creation of a new operating system because it allows the
programmer to directly interact with the system and manipulate the
memory as necessary. A large team of individuals will be working
on this project, and because of this it is very important that
the code created is easily readable, and can be understood by
many different people. Time will be saved in the long run because
more time will be able to spent on work rather than understanding
code written by others. Efficiency is also very important to this
project because the operating system will need to run quickly and
efficiently. This is key to the success of our new mobile operating
system because the customer will have a more positive reaction
with a fast and efficient product.

After careful consideration, I feel that the best language for this
project will be C. This language will satisfy all of the criteria
listed above and will allow us to execute at a high level when
creating this new operating system. First, C is well known for
being a 'mid' level language. It combines aspects of a low level
language, such as direct memory access, with those of a high level
language, such as easy readability. C will allow direct memory
access, and could be regarded as a 'high' level assembly code.
This will help the team to interact with the system as they program.
Second, C has a high level syntax that makes it easily readable.
Also, C is a widely used language, and because of this many people
are already familiar with it and the learning curve won't be as
steep for the team. Third, C has an unmatched runtime when compared to many
programming languages. C does very few processes behind the scenes,
such as garbage collection, and because of this it has a faster
runtime than many other languages. With all of this in mind, C was
a clear choice for this project. Not only, has C been around for a
very long time, but it remains the top choice for many operating
systems that we use everyday. On top of all the benefits of using C
listed above, C is also easily changed into assembly code. This
would be very beneficial in the creation of an operating system
because it allows the programmer to view assembly code when finding
and fixing bugs. C is a fundamental programming language, and I feel
that it will lead us to the most success in the pursuit of creating
a new mobile operating system.

Sincerely,
David Reko
